      continue access to  Support Services. Such requirement will be in
      accordance with the applicable Long Term Support (LTS) policy or any
      other applicable release notes. AxonIQ will endeavour to provide
      ninety (90) days advance notice of mandatory upgrades via email,
      in-app notification, or website posting, except for critical security
      updates which may require shorter notice. Failure to upgrade within 6
      months or any other specified timeframe may result in loss of Support
      Services, unless parties agree to paid extended support, and LICENSEE
      assumes all risks of using unsupported versions. AxonIQ reserves the
      right to implement automatic updates for security, compliance, or
      operational reasons, and AxonIQ shall not be liable for any costs or
      damages resulting from mandatory upgrade requirements or LICENSEE’s

      discretion upon Our prior notification.

9.    Orders, Fee, and Payment.

      (a) Orders. All Orders are subject to these Terms and are not binding
      until accepted by AxonIQ. Orders You create through the AxonIQ
      websites or the Platform are deemed accepted when AxonIQ provides
      access to the Software. All Orders are non-refundable except as
      expressly provided otherwise in these Terms.

      (b) Direct Orders. Sections c to f only apply to Orders placed
      directly with AxonIQ. If you purchase the Software through an AxonIQ
      authorized reseller, You will pay the reseller for such purchase, and
      different terms may apply.

      (c) Fees and Payment. You agree to pay AxonIQ all fees incurred for
      using the Software and any additional fees specified in an Order. All
      amounts payable under this Agreement will be due within thirty (30)
      days from the invoice date.

      (d) Taxes. Unless stated otherwise in an Order, You shall, in
      addition to the other amounts payable under this Agreement, pay all
      applicable customs, duties, sales, use, value-added, withholding, or
      other taxes, federal, state, or otherwise, however designated, which
      are levied or imposed because of the transactions contemplated by
      this Agreement, excluding only taxes based on AxonIQ's net income. If
      You are compelled to make a deduction or set-off for any such taxes,
      You will pay AxonIQ such additional amounts as are necessary to
      ensure receipt by AxonIQ of the total amount AxonIQ would have
      received but for the deduction.

      (e) Credit Card Payments. Unless otherwise agreed in an Order,
      payment must be made by credit card. AxonIQ uses a third-party credit
      card processing service to process payments. You consent to the use
      of such service and to the transfer of Your credit card details to
      such third-party processor. You agree to be bound by any terms
      applicable to the processing service.

      (f) Late Payment. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5%
      per month ( or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the
      payment due date until paid in full. Upon notice AxonIQ may suspend
      your access to the Software or Support Services for failure to pay
      any amounts when due. If payment has not been received by AxonIQ
      within 15 days after notification to that effect then AxonIQ may
      terminate the Agreement.

      (g) Modification of Fees. AxonIQ shall be entitled to modify its fees
      and/or its fee structure at any time upon 30 days prior notice by
      notification on its websites and/or the the Platform. In such case
      You accept such modifications by Your continued use of the Software.

10.   Verification/Audit. At AxonIQ's written request, not more frequently
      than annually, LICENSEE will furnish AxonIQ with a signed
      certification verifying that the Software is being used in accordance
      with the provisions of this Agreement. AxonIQ may not, more
      frequently than annually, audit LICENSEE's use of the Software unless
      AxonIQ reasonably believes that a violation of this Agreement has occurred.

      Any such audit will be conducted during regular business hours at
      LICENSEE's facilities and will not unreasonably interfere with
      LICENSEE's business activities. If an audit reveals that LICENSEE is
      using Software contrary to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement, then LICENSEE will be invoiced for additional license fees
      consistent with LICENSEE's actual use of the Software in accordance
      with AxonIQ's then current price list for the Software, which amount
      will be immediately due and payable. This assessment of additional
      fees will be without prejudice to any other remedies AxonIQ may have
      for breach of this Agreement, including without limitation,
      termination under Section 8 (Term and Termination).

      Non-Production Free Licenses, the following additional verification
      requirements apply:

      environments where the Software is deployed; (iii) the nature and

      details of such use including duration, scale, and business purpose.

      (b) Audit Rights. AxonIQ reserves the right, upon reasonable written
      notice and during normal business hours, to audit your compliance
      with this license if AxonIQ has reason to believe that you have
      breached any license terms, with such determination to be made in
      AxonIQ's sole discretion. Such audits may include: (i) inspection of
      your or your organisation's systems, networks, and computing
      environments where the Software is or has been installed; (ii) review
      of documentation, records, logs, and other materials relating to your
      deployment and use of the Software; (iii) interviews with technical
      and administrative personnel within your organisation; and (iv)
      engagement of qualified auditors to conduct such inspection on
      AxonIQ's behalf. You shall provide reasonable cooperation and access
      necessary for such audits.

      (c) Non-Production Use Enforcement. Unauthorized production use of
      Software licensed under Non-Production Free License may result in:
      (i) immediate liability for all applicable commercial license fees

      attorneys' fees and costs of enforcement.

11.   Confidential Information.
      (a) Each party shall retain in confidence the non-public information
      and know-how disclosed or made available by the other party pursuant
      to this Agreement, which is either designated in writing as
      proprietary and/or confidential, if disclosed in writing, or if
      disclosed orally, is designated in writing (which may be via email)
      as confidential within thirty (30) days of the oral disclosure or
      should reasonably be understood to be confidential by the recipient
      ("Confidential Information"). Notwithstanding any failure to so
      designate it, the Software, including the Documentation, the terms
      and pricing under this Agreement and all intellectual property and
      trade secrets of AxonIQ are considered AxonIQ's Confidential
      Information. Each party shall (a) maintain the confidentiality of the
      other party's Confidential Information using at least a reasonable
      degree of care; (b) refrain from using the other party's Confidential
      Information except for the purpose of performing its obligations
      under this Agreement; and (c) not disclose Confidential Information
      to any third party except to employees, subcontractors and agents as
      is reasonably required in connection with this Agreement and who are
      subject to confidentiality obligations at least as protective as
      those outlined in this section. Results of any benchmark tests on the
      Software run by You may not be disclosed outside of Your organization
      without the prior written consent of AxonIQ. Each party shall
      immediately notify the other party of any unauthorized disclosure or
      use of any Confidential Information and assist the other party in
      remedying such unauthorized use or disclosure by taking steps
      reasonably requested by such other party. The foregoing obligations
      will not apply to Confidential Information of the other party which
      (i) is or becomes publicly known without breach of this Agreement;
      (ii) is discovered or created by the receiving party without the use
      of, or reference to, the Confidential Information of the disclosing
      party, as shown in records of the receiving party; or (iii) is
      otherwise known to the receiving party without confidentiality
      restrictions and through no wrongful conduct of the receiving party.
      The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information to the
      extent required by law or court order if the receiving party provides
      prompt notice and reasonable assistance to the disclosing party to
      enable the disclosing party to seek a protective order or otherwise
      prevent or restrict such disclosure ("Permitted Disclosures").
